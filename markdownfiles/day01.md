## HTML
* Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
* HTML is the raw data that a webpage is built out of. All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML.

## CSS
* Stands for Cascading Style Sheet
* HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great! 
* Used to alter the layout and formatting of your website.  

>**Note:**
Many great resources out there keep referring to HTML and CSS as programming languages, but if you want to get technical, labeling them as such is not quite accurate, because they are only concerned with presenting information. They are not used to program any logic.

## JavaScript
* JavaScript is a programming language,which gives you the tools that you need to alter the behavior of different elements that are found on a website page. With this tool, you can add a layer of interactivity to the CSS and HTML elements on your website.
