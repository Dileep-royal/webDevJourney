## HTML
* Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
* HTML is the raw data that a webpage is built out of. All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML.

## CSS
* Stands for Cascading Style Sheet
* HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great! 
* Used to alter the layout and formatting of your website.  

>**Note:**
Many great resources out there keep referring to HTML and CSS as programming languages, but if you want to get technical, labeling them as such is not quite accurate, because they are only concerned with presenting information. They are not used to program any logic.

## JavaScript
* JavaScript is a programming language,which gives you the tools that you need to alter the behavior of different elements that are found on a website page. With this tool, you can add a layer of interactivity to the CSS and HTML elements on your website.


# HTML
* HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of webpages. We use HTML elements to create all of the paragraphs, headings, lists, images, and links that make up a typical webpage
* Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.
* Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element. They are comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets <>.
* Closing tags ends the HTML element and uses a forward slash before keyword i.e,</>
* HTML has a vast list of predefined tags that you can use to create all kinds of different elements. 
* It is important to use the correct tags for content. 
* Using the correct tags can have a big impact on two aspects of your sites
1. How they are ranked in search engines 
2. How accessible they are to users who rely on assistive technologies, like screen readers, to use the internet.

## Basic Structure of HTML file
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

* doctype declaration purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document.
* html element is whatâ€™s known as the root element of the document and has an lang attribute to specify the language of text content.
* head elememt consists of meta information of our web page and have descendants elements like meta & title 
* meta element to display special characters and symbols from different languages in the browser and title element to display title on the browser's tab.
