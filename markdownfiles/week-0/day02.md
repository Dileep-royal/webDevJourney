# ======= Day - 02 ========
on day-02,i get to know about following things:
* listing 
* Creating simple form
* Client-side form validation


# listing 

listing have two types
1. ordered listing 
2. unordered listing
**ordered:**
* There is a sequence to list out the items
* We have the following listing marker types:
1. a
2. A
3. i
4. I
5. 1
**unordered:**
* unordered means there is no sequence
* We have the following listing marker types:
1. circle
2. square
3. disc
4. none
* we also can use styling property `HTML style="list-style-type:"` to define marking type
* Using this styling property we can also use ordered listing types

* we may also required some crucial attributes like as follows:
1. type
2. reversed
3. start

It is also possible to do nested listing(combination of both un-ordered & ordered listing)

# Creating a simple form

In order to create a form,we have to know  about different tags like input types,button types,textarea,select,optgroup,label,fieldset,legend,datalist,check box,radio box,etc..
* we may also required some crucial attributes like as follows:
1. required
2. autocomplete="on"
3. autofocus
4. min
5. max
6. step
7. selected
8. pattern

# Client-side form validation
* When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application.
* Done in two ways
1. Built-in form validation
2. using javascript

## Built-in form validation

They are:
* required
* minlength
* maxlength
* min
* max
